== Introduction

This document provides the C4 model architecture documentation for the SwatStockConsole application.
The diagrams are automatically generated based on code analysis using DeepSeek AI.

== C4 Model

The C4 model is a simple way to document software architecture using four levels:

1. System Context: People and software systems
2. Containers: Applications and data stores
3. Components: Groups of related functionality
4. Code: Classes, interfaces, etc.

=== System Context Diagram

- ChartService: Renders ASCII-based candlestick charts
- JsonUtility: Parses JSON responses from the API
- Client: Orchestrates the application flow
- DailyPriceData: Data model for daily stock price information
